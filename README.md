# GTP
The Geodesic Treepath Problem (GTP) algorithm is a polynomial algorithm to compute geodesic distance between two phylogenetic trees in tree space [1]. The algorithm is proposed in [2].

## Two Examples 
1. Geodesic computation 

- This example computes the geodesic from the starting tree and ending tree. 

- Starting tree (1:0.86,(2:0.58,3:0.30,4:0.97,5:0.50,6:0.86):0.41,0:0)

- Ending tree (((1:0.87,2:0.12,3:0.20):0.14,4:0.50):0.54,(5:0.63,6:0.22):0.42,0:0)

2. Treepath interpolation
